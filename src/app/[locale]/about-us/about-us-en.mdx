# About TUMULT

Our definition of Tumult is born out of friendship.

We are motivated by the awareness of this kind of togetherness and this is what we want to feel and share with you at our events.

We want to create experiences with you that enable us to escape from everyday life for a few hours and to recharge our batteries for everything that awaits us outside this sensitive space.

To achieve this, we focus on positive interaction in communication and action and on community.
These are the basic conditions that can make this wish possible for us.

We want diversity, not only on the dance floor and behind the decks, but also in all other places.
To open a space that is truly inclusive, leaving no person behind who feels the same as we do.

## [Activism](#activism)<a id='activism'></a>

We as Tumult see ourselves as political. For us, that means defining our values, as well as constantly striving to act on them, and reflecting on ourselves and those actions.

Among other things, this means that we consciously choose the places for our events, organise ourselves without rigid hierarchies and communicate the guiding principles of our values to all those involved.

We want to create free spaces, away from the normativity of existing social concepts, but at the same time remain true to our guiding principles and continue to support solidarity actions.

We also want to support the local scene through our events and give new talents a platform to share their art with us.

## [Price Policy](#pricepolicy)<a id='pricepolicy'></a>

We see ourselves as a non-profit collective and will continue to try to counteract the price development.
We will continue to offer free admission to people without sufficient financial means.

We want to motivate our guests to think and act in solidarity, for example, by donating to important action alliances and also by making our space accessible to everyone.

All this is subject to constant development and also lives from your [feedback](mailto:feedback@tumult.club).
